# Deep-Burst-SR
Implementation of [Deep Burst Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10997.pdf), by Bhat et al. and slightly modified by Eduardo Barreto Brito (ebb2@cin.ufpe.br) to include pre-trained layers on the Fusion Module. The pre-trained layers models are based on the ResNET (He et al. in [Deep residual learning for image recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)). 

This implementation is for study only, designed as an assignment for Image Processing discipline at UFPE - Masters on Computer Science 2022.2.
